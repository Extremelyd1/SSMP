# SSMP

## What is Silksong Multiplayer?
As the name might suggest, Silksong Multiplayer (SSMP) is a multiplayer mod for the popular 2D action-adventure game Hollow Knight: Silksong.
The main purpose of this mod is to allow people to host games and let others join them in their adventures.
There is a dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KbgxvDyzHP) for the mod where you can ask questions or generally talk about the mod.
Moreover, you can leave suggestions or bug reports. The latest announcements will be posted there.
